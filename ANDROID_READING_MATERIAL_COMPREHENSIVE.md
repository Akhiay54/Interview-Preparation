## Kotlin Fundamentals

### Null Safety in Kotlin

**Understanding Null Safety:**
Kotlin's null safety is a compile-time feature that prevents null pointer exceptions by distinguishing between nullable and non-nullable types. This is one of Kotlin's most important features for Android development.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Non-nullable types**: Cannot hold null values (e.g., `String`, `Int`)
- **Nullable types**: Can hold null values (e.g., `String?`, `Int?`)
- **Safe call operator (`?.`)**: Only calls the method if the object is not null
- **Elvis operator (`?:`)**: Provides a default value when the expression is null
- **Not-null assertion (`!!`)**: Forces a nullable type to be treated as non-null (use carefully)

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents runtime crashes from null pointer exceptions
- Makes code more predictable and safer
- Reduces the need for null checks throughout the codebase
- Improves code readability and maintainability

**Best Practices:**
- Prefer non-nullable types when possible
- Use safe calls instead of null checks
- Avoid not-null assertions unless absolutely necessary
- Use the Elvis operator for providing default values

### Data Classes

**What are Data Classes:**
Data classes are a special type of class in Kotlin designed to hold data. They automatically generate several useful methods based on the properties declared in the primary constructor.

**Auto-generated Methods:**
- `equals()`: Structural equality comparison
- `hashCode()`: Hash code generation
- `toString()`: String representation
- `copy()`: Creates a copy with modified properties
- `componentN()`: Destructuring declarations

**Benefits:**
- Reduces boilerplate code significantly
- Ensures consistent behavior for data objects
- Makes code more readable and maintainable
- Provides immutable data structures by default

**When to Use:**
- For model classes that primarily hold data
- When you need structural equality
- For API response models
- For database entities

### Extension Functions

**Concept:**
Extension functions allow you to add new functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code or using inheritance. They're a powerful feature for creating utility functions and improving code organization.

**Key Points:**
- They don't actually modify the original class
- They're resolved statically at compile time
- They can access public members of the class
- They can be imported and used like regular functions

**Benefits:**
- Improves code readability
- Reduces the need for utility classes
- Makes code more expressive
- Follows Kotlin's functional programming principles

**Common Use Cases:**
- View extensions for common operations
- String utilities
- Collection operations
- Context extensions for common tasks

## Android Architecture Components

### ViewModel

**Purpose and Role:**
ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It survives configuration changes like screen rotations and provides a clean separation between UI logic and data management.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Lifecycle-aware**: Survives configuration changes
- **Data holder**: Stores UI state and data
- **Communication bridge**: Between Repository and UI
- **Scope**: Lives as long as the associated UI component

**Benefits:**
- Survives configuration changes automatically
- Prevents memory leaks
- Provides a clean architecture pattern
- Enables better testing

**Best Practices:**
- Never pass Context or View references to ViewModel
- Use LiveData or StateFlow for reactive updates
- Keep ViewModels focused and single-purpose
- Handle configuration changes gracefully

### LiveData

**Concept:**
LiveData is an observable data holder class that is lifecycle-aware. It respects the lifecycle of other app components and automatically manages subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.

**Key Features:**
- **Lifecycle-aware**: Only updates active lifecycle owners
- **Observable**: Notifies observers when data changes
- **Memory leak safe**: Automatically manages subscriptions
- **Configuration change safe**: Survives configuration changes

**Lifecycle States:**
- **STARTED**: Component is in started state
- **RESUMED**: Component is in resumed state
- **DESTROYED**: Component is destroyed

**Benefits:**
- Automatic lifecycle management
- No memory leaks
- Configuration change handling
- Reactive programming support

### Room Database

**Overview:**
Room is a persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite. It allows for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

**Components:**
- **Entity**: Represents a table in the database
- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: Contains methods for accessing the database
- **Database**: Contains the database holder and serves as the main access point

**Key Features:**
- **Compile-time verification**: SQL queries are validated at compile time
- **Convenient annotations**: Reduces boilerplate code
- **Observable queries**: Returns LiveData or Flow for reactive updates
- **Type converters**: Handles complex data types

**Benefits:**
- Type-safe database access
- Compile-time query validation
- Reactive data updates
- Reduced boilerplate code

## Jetpack Compose Deep Dive

### Composition vs Recomposition

**Composition:**
Composition is the process of describing the UI by executing composable functions. It's the initial creation of the UI tree.

**Recomposition:**
Recomposition is the process of updating the UI when state changes. Compose automatically recomposes only the parts of the UI that need to be updated.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Smart recomposition**: Only recomposes what's necessary
- **Stable types**: Types that Compose can optimize for recomposition
- **Side effects**: Operations that happen outside of composition
- **State hoisting**: Moving state up in the component hierarchy

**Performance Considerations:**
- Minimize unnecessary recompositions
- Use stable types when possible
- Avoid expensive operations in composables
- Use remember and derivedStateOf appropriately

### State Management in Compose

**State Types:**
- **mutableStateOf**: Mutable state that triggers recomposition
- **remember**: Caches values across recompositions
- **rememberSaveable**: Survives process death and configuration changes
- **derivedStateOf**: Computed state that depends on other state

**State Hoisting:**
State hoisting is the pattern of moving state up in the component hierarchy to make components more reusable and testable.

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth
- Better testability
- Improved reusability
- Clearer data flow

**Best Practices:**
- Hoist state to the lowest common ancestor
- Use unidirectional data flow
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Use sealed classes for complex state

### Side Effects

**LaunchedEffect:**
LaunchedEffect is used for side effects that need to be cancelled and relaunched when the key changes. It's perfect for one-shot operations.

**DisposableEffect:**
DisposableEffect is used for side effects that need cleanup when the composable leaves the composition.

**SideEffect:**
SideEffect is used for side effects that should run on every successful composition.

**ProduceState:**
ProduceState is used to convert non-Compose state into Compose state.

**Key Points:**
- Side effects should be predictable and controlled
- Use appropriate side effect for the use case
- Always clean up resources when necessary
- Avoid side effects in composable functions

## Coroutines & Asynchronous Programming

### Understanding Coroutines

**What are Coroutines:**
Coroutines are a way to write asynchronous, non-blocking code in a sequential manner. They're lightweight threads that can be created in large numbers without the overhead of actual threads.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Suspend functions**: Functions that can be paused and resumed
- **Coroutine scope**: Defines the lifecycle of coroutines
- **Dispatcher**: Determines which thread pool the coroutine runs on
- **Job**: Represents a cancellable unit of work

**Benefits:**
- **Sequential code**: Write async code that looks synchronous
- **Lightweight**: Can create thousands of coroutines
- **Structured concurrency**: Automatic cancellation and error handling
- **Exception handling**: Built-in error handling mechanisms

### Coroutine Scopes

**GlobalScope:**
GlobalScope is a scope that lives for the entire application lifetime. It should be used sparingly as it can lead to memory leaks.

**LifecycleScope:**
LifecycleScope is tied to the lifecycle of a component (Activity, Fragment). Coroutines in this scope are automatically cancelled when the component is destroyed.

**ViewModelScope:**
ViewModelScope is tied to the ViewModel lifecycle. Coroutines in this scope survive configuration changes but are cancelled when the ViewModel is cleared.

**CoroutineScope:**
Custom scope that can be created and managed manually.

**Best Practices:**
- Use appropriate scope for the use case
- Avoid GlobalScope in most cases
- Cancel coroutines when they're no longer needed
- Handle exceptions appropriately

### Dispatchers

**Dispatchers.Main:**
Runs on the main thread. Used for UI updates and interactions.

**Dispatchers.IO:**
Optimized for disk and network I/O operations. Uses a shared pool of threads.

**Dispatchers.Default:**
Optimized for CPU-intensive work. Uses a shared pool of threads.

**Dispatchers.Unconfined:**
Not confined to any specific thread. Should be used carefully.

**Custom Dispatchers:**
Can be created for specific use cases.

**When to Use Each:**
- **Main**: UI updates, user interactions
- **IO**: Network calls, database operations, file I/O
- **Default**: Complex calculations, sorting, parsing
- **Unconfined**: Rare cases where you need specific thread behavior

### Exception Handling

**try-catch:**
Traditional exception handling within coroutines.

**CoroutineExceptionHandler:**
Global exception handler for coroutines.

**supervisorScope:**
Scope where child coroutine failures don't affect siblings.

**Benefits of Structured Concurrency:**
- Automatic cancellation propagation
- Proper exception handling
- Resource cleanup
- Predictable behavior

---

## Threading & Concurrency

### Android Threading Model

**Main Thread (UI Thread):**
The main thread is responsible for:
- Drawing the UI
- Handling user input
- Processing lifecycle events
- Running animations

**Background Threads:**
Background threads are used for:
- Network operations
- Database operations
- File I/O
- Heavy computations

**Thread Safety:**
Thread safety ensures that data structures can be safely accessed from multiple threads without corruption.

**Common Issues:**
- **Race conditions**: When the outcome depends on thread execution order
- **Deadlocks**: When threads wait for each other indefinitely
- **Memory leaks**: When threads hold references to objects

### Threading Best Practices

**Never Block the Main Thread:**
- Move heavy operations to background threads
- Use coroutines for asynchronous operations
- Keep UI operations on the main thread

**Use Appropriate Threading Mechanisms:**
- **Coroutines**: For most asynchronous operations
- **ExecutorService**: For thread pool management
- **Handler**: For posting work to specific threads
- **AsyncTask**: Deprecated, avoid using

**Thread Safety Patterns:**
- **Synchronization**: Using synchronized blocks
- **Atomic operations**: Using atomic classes
- **Thread-safe collections**: Using concurrent collections
- **Immutable objects**: Using immutable data structures

### Handler and Looper

**Handler:**
Handler is used to send and process Message and Runnable objects associated with a thread's MessageQueue.

**Looper:**
Looper is a class used to run a message loop for a thread. It processes messages from the MessageQueue.

**MessageQueue:**
MessageQueue is a queue of messages that can be processed by a Looper.

**Use Cases:**
- Posting work to the main thread
- Delayed execution
- Periodic execution
- Inter-thread communication

## Android Lifecycle Management

### Activity Lifecycle

**Lifecycle States:**
1. **onCreate()**: Called when the activity is first created
2. **onStart()**: Called when the activity becomes visible
3. **onResume()**: Called when the activity is interactive
4. **onPause()**: Called when the activity is partially visible
5. **onStop()**: Called when the activity is not visible
6. **onDestroy()**: Called when the activity is destroyed

**Configuration Changes:**
Configuration changes (like rotation) cause the activity to be destroyed and recreated. ViewModel helps preserve data during these changes.

**Process Death:**
When the system kills the app process, all activities are destroyed. Use onSaveInstanceState() to preserve critical data.

### Fragment Lifecycle

**Lifecycle States:**
1. **onAttach()**: Called when fragment is attached to activity
2. **onCreate()**: Called when fragment is created
3. **onCreateView()**: Called to create the fragment's view
4. **onViewCreated()**: Called after view is created
5. **onStart()**: Called when fragment becomes visible
6. **onResume()**: Called when fragment is interactive
7. **onPause()**: Called when fragment is partially visible
8. **onStop()**: Called when fragment is not visible
9. **onDestroyView()**: Called when fragment's view is destroyed
10. **onDestroy()**: Called when fragment is destroyed
11. **onDetach()**: Called when fragment is detached from activity

**Fragment Communication:**
- **Shared ViewModel**: For communication between fragments
- **Interface callbacks**: For parent-child communication
- **Event bus**: For loose coupling (use sparingly)

### Lifecycle-Aware Components

**LifecycleOwner:**
Interface that has an Android lifecycle. Activities and Fragments implement this interface.

**LifecycleObserver:**
Interface for objects that can observe lifecycle events.

**Benefits:**
- Automatic lifecycle management
- No memory leaks
- Cleaner code
- Better resource management
