- Problems with ‚Äúmaximum/minimum/at most/exactly K‚Äù in a continuous range.

**Key Tricks:**  
- For **fixed-size windows**, move both pointers together.
- For **variable-size windows**, expand right, shrink left to restore constraints.
- Use hash maps or frequency counters for characters or distinct elements.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Two Pointers

**When to use:**  
- Sorted arrays/lists, pair sums, partitions, duplicates removal.

**Key Tricks:**  
- One pointer starts at the beginning, one at the end.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fast & Slow Pointers

**When to use:**  
- Detecting cycles in linked lists, arrays.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Search

**When to use:**

- Search space reduction, boundaries, or ‚Äúfirst true/false‚Äù type problems.

**Key Tricks:**  
- Think: ‚ÄúIs this value possible?‚Äù
- Adjust mid carefully to avoid infinite loops.
- Use `low + (high - low) // 2` for overflow safety.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Backtracking

**When to use:**  
- Generate all valid combinations, permutations, or arrangements with constraints.

**Key Tricks:**

---

### 6.6 DP + Knapsack

**When to use:**  
- Subset sums, resource allocation.

**Key Tricks:**  
- `dp[i][j]` ‚Üí best value using first `i` items with capacity `j`.
- Decide: pick or skip current item.

---

### 6.7 DP + Monotonic Queue

**When to use:**  
- DP with sliding window optimization.

**Key Tricks:**  
- Maintain a deque to keep max/min values.
- Useful for large constraints that make normal DP too slow.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Greedy

**When to use:**  
- Local optimal choices lead to global optimal solution.

**Key Tricks:**  
- Prove why greedy works (no counterexamples).
- Sort input based on benefit/cost.

- Use Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm (BFS) or DFS post-order.
- If processed nodes < total ‚Üí there‚Äôs a cycle.

---
