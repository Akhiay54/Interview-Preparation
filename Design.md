## Section 2 — Interview‑Style High‑Impact System Design Questions

Each expects architecture thinking, rationale, and trade-offs:

1. **Work Scheduling from Scratch**
   - Craft a replacement for WorkManager using JobScheduler, AlarmManager, BootReceiver, Room DB, custom dispatcher.
   - Must handle constraints, retry/backoff, chaining, reboot survival.

2. **Downloader SDK**
   - Pause/resume downloads, chunked uploads, integrity checks, state persistence and crash recovery.

3. **Analytics SDK**
   - Batch events, local persistence, retry/backoff, server payload size, configurability.

4. **Offline-Sync Note App**
   - Room DB offline edits, sync queue, conflict detection/resolution, last‑write‑wins vs merging.

5. **Ride-Tracking App Design (Chalo-like)**
   - Periodic location updates, battery optimization, trip state flow, offline buffering, sync when online.

6. **Scalable News Feed App**
   - Cache & local pagination, remote sync strategy, WorkManager periodic background refresh, Compose + paging, FCM for updates. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

7. **Chat Application (WhatsApp style)**
   - UI optimistic updates, WebSocket or FCM, ack states, offline message queue in Room, reconnection strategy. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

8. **Architecture Decisions**
   - MVVM vs MVI vs Redux, modular splits (feature/domain/data), single activity vs multi‑activity, Compose vs XML.

9. **Permissions & Lifecycle Edge Cases**
   - `onSaveInstanceState()` vs ViewModels vs Room for multi-activity/rotation state persistence. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

10. **Coroutine & Concurrency Deep Dive**
    - Flow vs StateFlow vs SharedFlow, cancellation via supervisorScope, structure concurrency in ViewModel and use-case layers. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

11. **Performance & App Size Optimization**
    - Gradle modularization, using configuration cache, multiDex, resource shrinking, image caching strategy.

12. **Security & Reverse Engineering**
    - Database encryption, token rotation, obfuscation, deep link hijack protection, Play Integrity API.

## Section 3 — Framework & Interview Techniques

From proandroiddev and mobile design guides: :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

- Clarify scope: client-only vs client+backend.
- Gather functional & non‑functional/scale requirements.
- Ask “out-of-scope” to limit problem.
- Provide high-level diagrams before diving deep.
- Clearly communicate assumptions, trade-offs, boundary conditions (offline, reboot, airplane mode, interruptions).

---

## Section 4 — Concrete Additional Questions from Online Sources

- Explain a scalable, modular Android app architecture and when clean architecture is overkill. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Design an Android caching mechanism: multiple layers (memory, disk), eviction strategy, invalidation. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Compare single activity vs multi‑activity pattern in large apps. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Handle push-based vs pull‑based sync design trade-offs. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- In-memory vs persistent storage: compliance vs speed trade‑offs. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Section 5 — Your Prep Workflow

1. Pick **top 3–5 questions**: e.g. WorkScheduler, ride‑tracking, analytics SDK, news feed, Clean Architecture.
2. Clarify assumptions: API level targets, offline tolerance, user scale, failure modes.
3. Sketch architecture (UI, VM, Repo, DB, dispatcher, sync logic).
4. Define data flow, edge cases, retry/backoff, battery/network trade‑offs.
5. Build minimal prototypes for 1–2 labs: e.g. task scheduling with constraints, offline sync with Room.
6. Practice STAR stories for system/behavioral: technical debt, bug fix, feature design.

## Section 6 — What Interviewers Are Evaluating

- Do you clarify **scope and requirements** first?
- Can you articulate **system trade-offs**: battery vs reliability, offline vs fresh?
- Do you know **Android internals**: JobScheduler vs WorkManager vs AlarmManager, Compose recomposition, scope & cancellation?
- Can you **modularize and create scalable architecture**?
- Do you balance **pluggable SDK design**, security, offline resilience and performance?

This plan is built for **depth**, **real-world technical thinking**, and **mock-style prep**.  
You'll master not just APIs—but how to reason, architect, and deliver robust systems under pressure. 💪```
